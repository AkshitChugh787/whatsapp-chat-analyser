You may have great knowledge but nothing to showcase for its validity, so ig take a valid certification if possible rather than self study for a head start.\n",
      "11/28/22, 21:42 - +91 89298 91510: Agreed, for just instance and to add and edge we need it specially as a fresher, but in internships, placements they don't matter at all, ig in anyone's pov who cares if you actually did that course from udemy Or etc stuff or not\n",

      "11/28/22, 21:45 - +91 74289 45232: udemy, not valid certification, in placements they ask for an internship brand or not even that, if you have a patent or published paper, it counts as valid experience nothing more, but if you are so capable u rather go for off campus or research, thats how it goes.\n",
